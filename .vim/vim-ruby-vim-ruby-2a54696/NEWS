== Vim 6.4

This release is included in Vim 6.4.

Ruby filetype plugin - symbols were incorrectly being matched as match_words
causing the matchit motion command to jump to an incorrect location in some
circumstances.


= 2005.10.05

== Bug Fixes

Ruby syntax file - allow for comments directly after module/class/def lines
without intervening whitespace (fold markers were breaking syntax highlighting).

Ruby filetype plugin - improve ordering of 'path' elements.

eRuby syntax file - make use of ruby_no_expensive local to the buffer.

== Filetype Detection

The eruby filetype is now detected solely based on the file's extension. This
was being overridden by the scripts.vim detection script.

Note: Only files ending in *.rhtml are detected as filetype eruby since these
are currently assumed to be Ruby embedded in (X)HTML only. Other filetypes
could be supported if requested.

== eRuby Indent File

There is a new eRuby indent file which simply sources the HTML indent file for
now.

== eRuby Compiler Plugin 

This now supports erb as the default 'makeprg'. To use eruby set the
eruby_compiler variable to "eruby" in your .vimrc

== Test::Unit Compiler Plugin

This has been improved and should now display messages similar to, though more
detailed than, the GUI test runners.

== Bug Fixes

A few minor bugs have been fixed in the Ruby syntax and indent files.


= 2005.09.15

== eRuby Support

There are new syntax, compiler, and ftplugin files for eRuby.  This support is
incomplete and we're keen to hear of any problems or suggestions you may have
to improve it.

== Ruby Filetype Support

The Ruby filetype plugin has been improved to include as many useful settings
as possible without intruding too much on an individual user's preferences.
Matchit support has been improved, and the following options are now set to
appropriate values: comments, commentstring, formatoptions, include,
includeexpr, path, and suffixesadd

== Filetype Detection

The new ftdetect mechanism of Vim 6.3 is being utilized to enable filetype
detection of eRuby files until this is officially added to the next release of
Vim.

== Installation Directories

The installer script now, where possible, automatically determines both the
user and system-wide preferences directory.

== Bug Fixes

A large number of bugs have been fixed in the Ruby syntax and indent files.
