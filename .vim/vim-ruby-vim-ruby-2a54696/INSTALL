= Installing Vim-Ruby

The Vim-Ruby runtime files may be installed via the vim-ruby gem or by
downloading an archive file from http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=16

NOTE: the installer vim-ruby-install.rb currently only supports Unix and
Windows systems; other platforms may require a manual install.  This installer
is new and users with significant local modifications to their vim-ruby files
are encouraged to make a manual backup of each prior to installation.

== Prerequisites

1. Vim 6.x (6.3 recommended)
   http://www.vim.org/

2. Ruby 1.8.x
   http://www.ruby-lang.org/

== Gem Installation

Install the gem and run the installer which will automatically determine the
two recommended installation locations and prompt you to select one, or allow
you to specify a directory of your own choosing.

$ gem install vim-ruby --remote
$ vim-ruby-install.rb

== Archive File Installation

Unpack the archive file and run the installer which will automatically
determine the two recommended installation locations or allow you to specify
one.

Unix

$ tar -xzf vim-ruby.YYYY.MM.DD.tgz
$ ./vim-ruby.YYY.MM.DD/bin/vim-ruby-install.rb

Windows

C:\tmp> [unzip] vim-ruby.YYYY.MM.DD.tgz
C:\tmp> ruby vim-ruby.YYY.MM.DD\bin\vim-ruby-install.rb

=== Manual Installation

Alternatively, you can simply copy the desired files to an appropriate
directory in your runtime path.  For single user use this would typically be
$HOME/.vim on Unix systems and $HOME/vimfiles on Windows and for system-wide
use these would be installed in $VIM/vimfiles.

== Vim versions < 6.3

For versions of Vim less than 6.3 the supplied ftdetect/ruby.vim file, used for
filetype detection, will be ignored.  In order for the filetype detection to
operate correctly the autocommands specified in ftdetect/ruby.vim need to be
executed.  See :help new-filetype, in Vim, for a mechanism to achieve this
which is appropriate for your version of Vim.

Again, we recommend you use the latest version of Vim at all times, where
possible.

== Problems

If you have any problems installing the Vim-Ruby configuration files please
send a message to the mailing list (http://rubyforge.org/mail/?group_id=16) or
post an item to the tracker (http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?group_id=16).
